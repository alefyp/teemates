          League of Legends is a team-based strategy game where two teams of
          five powerful champions face off to destroy the otherâ€™s base. You can
          choose from over 140 champions to make epic plays, secure kills, and
          take down towers as you battle your way to victory.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <strong>
          But wait a minute... 140 champions? That's a lot! How can I choose
          one?
        </strong>
